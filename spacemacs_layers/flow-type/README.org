#+TITLE: flow-type layer

* Description
This layer adds some [[https://flowtype.org/][flow]] related functionality to Emacs.
 - It prints the flow-type of the object under the cursor to Emacs' echo area.  (Adapted from @almost's work at https://gist.github.com/almost/5547b7f3a79604d85ac6)
 - It adds flow checking to flycheck (based on the flycheck-flow package)

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =flow-type= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
